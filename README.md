[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

This is a breakout board for the CEM3340/AS3340 chip. It is designed to be relatively simple for beginners to put together and to have flexible mounting options. If you do not require certain features such as pulse width control, hard sync, frequency modulation control, or a triangle, square, or ramp wave, it is possible to omit components so as to avoid the unwanted features.
